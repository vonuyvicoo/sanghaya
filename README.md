Because finding sources should be easy. Sanghaya is an open-source web-based project that scrapes data from Semantic Scholar or Google Scholar to reverse-search citations for your academic paper. Watch the demo video below for reference.

# Usage
Run `npm start` to start server. It opens up a page at port `8880`. In the case that you need to setup Google Scholar you need to provide your Apify token on a `.env` file with the following syntax:
```.env
apifyToken="apify_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
